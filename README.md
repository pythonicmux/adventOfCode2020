# Advent of Code 2020 (Partially Completed) Solutions

For interview prep this year, I worked on Advent of Code 2020's released problems at https://adventofcode.com/2020

In December, a set of two problems is released each day. The problems start off easy but get progressively harder. 

You get a star for each problem you solve. The first problem of each day is based on some storyline, and then the 
second problem will be a harder "twist" on the first problem. 

I got two stars on days 1-17, and only one star on days 18 and 19. I stopped after looking at day 20 because 
I got lazy.

My solutions are very messy, and I didn't comment them out super nicely. This repo is just to record my progress, and 
to possibly come back and finish the last week of problems.
