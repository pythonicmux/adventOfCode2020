# Advent of Code 2020 (Partially Completed) Solutions

For interview prep this year, I worked on Advent of Code 2020's released problems at https://adventofcode.com/2020 

This repo is just to record my progress, and to possibly come back and finish the last week of problems. 

Each December, a set of two problems is released each day from 12/1-12/25. 
You get a star for each problem you solve. The first problem of each day is based on some storyline, and then the 
second problem will be a harder "twist" on the first problem. 

The problems start off easy but get progressively harder. Personally I felt that days 18+ were significantly 
harder than days 1-17, and couldn't find the solutions to the second problems on day 18 and 19. (Also day 13 took me a 
long time to figure out!)

I got two stars on days 1-17, and only one star on days 18 and 19. I stopped after looking at day 20 because 
I got lazy. This repo has all of my solutions to the 

My solutions are very messy, and I didn't comment them out super nicely. I also realized that for days 1-17, I only have 
the solution to the second problems, since I modified the same file when writing the solution to the first and second problems.
